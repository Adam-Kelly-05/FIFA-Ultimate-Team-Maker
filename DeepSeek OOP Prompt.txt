            ". I want you to give me a list like that for the rest of the leagues i provieded. Just rememeber, the "team1" name of the variable doesn't start again, it keeps going, so dont restart it, the next object will be team 20 and so on, teamId is the same. Ranking describes their ranking in the league, so that will start again at 1 for every league. if the league doesnt have 20 teams, please put "?" instead of the number in the rank spot, dont count from 20 down, then just move onto the next league like normal. Use the final results from the 2023/24 season to get the order. do you have any questions or do you understand?
